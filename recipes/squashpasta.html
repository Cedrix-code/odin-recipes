        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups cubed butternut squash</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons rubbed dried sage</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add squash and sauté until fork-tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add garlic, sage, and thyme; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Fold in cream and spinach; bring to a simmer. Add 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper. Add ziti and toss until evenly coated. Cook until sauce has thickened, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Divide between 8 bowls. Top with walnuts and more Parmesan.</li>
